# INMERSION DE DATOS CON PYTHON

PANDAS:THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON TERMS WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PYTHON AND IN THIS REPOSITORY YOU WILL FIND SOME INFORMATION THAT WOULD HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND HOW AND WHEN YOU CAN USE IT.

MATPLOIT Y MATPLOIT.PYPLOT: HERE, IT IS WHERE YOU CAN FIND DIFFERENT GRAPHICS OR SHOW SOME OF YOUR DATAFRAME'S COLUMNS OR YOUR WHOLE DATASET IN SOME SPECIFIC WAYS. 

SEABORN: AMONG THE LIBRARIES MENTIONED BEFORE, HERE YOU CAN CREATE MORE REALISTIC AND FANTASTIC DESIGNS OF YOUR DATA WITH GRAPHICS LIKE BOXPLOT, MAP AND A ALOT OF NEW GENUINE DESIGNS.

THIS REPOSITORY WILL HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN MANAGE DATA ACCORDING TO SOME DOCUMENTATION DOWNLOADED FROM DANE'S OFICIAL SITE. DANE IS THE NATIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF STATISTICS IN BOGOTA, THEREFORE I USED THIS INFO IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN HOW TO USE PYTHON AND MACHINE LEARNING IN SOME BASIC SOCIOECONOMIC FIELDS.
